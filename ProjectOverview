Project Synopsis: Create a video game that is a rogue-like. 


Concept of Operation:A rogue-like video game is a dungeon crawling game that allows the player to proceed through 
various levels obtaining random gear to increase their power strength. As the player adventures further through the 
levels the enemies will become stronger and increase in number. The game will continue until the player defeats the 
final boss or the player dies. Once this happens the player will lose their character and must start a new character 
to play again. A new adventure will offer a different play style since the items dropped to the player will not always 
be the same as the last adventure.  



Estimate of the Effort:
Task Description
Requirements, Design, Code & Unit Test (CUT), Integration and Test (I&T) of the video game. 
The following identifies the anticipated components:
1. Development of the levels.
2. Development of the droppable items.
3. Development of the enemies.
4. Development of character design.

Productivity Factor	10 SLOC/Hour	Total Code 111.5 Hours		Total:1115

Assumptions:
1. 10 SLOC per hour productivity factor.
2. Unit Test code count is included in the estimate, but the time to develop unit test is included in
	the productivity factor.
3. Integration and Test time is included in the 10 SLOC per hour productivity factor.
4. Minimal design documentation is anticipated and included in the 10 SLOC estimate. 
5. The code and any documentation will be reviewed only by the developer.
